Sales Forecasting with Market, Weather, and Fuel Data

Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between sales, weather conditions, and fuel prices. The objective is to build a predictive model that forecasts sales based on these factors. The dataset includes historical sales data, weather reports, and fuel price variations to enhance prediction accuracy.

Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple files containing:

Sales Data: Market-wise sales details with quantity and pricing information.

Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors.

Fuel Pricing Data: Historical fuel price records that may influence market demand.

Project Workflow

Data Loading & Preprocessing

Merging datasets from different sources.

Handling missing values and outliers.

Encoding categorical variables and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summaries.

Visualizing trends and relationships using plots and correlation matrices.

Feature Selection & Scaling

Selecting key features affecting sales performance.

Normalizing data using MinMaxScaler.

Model Training & Evaluation

Implementing machine learning models such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Classifier
