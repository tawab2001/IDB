## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between sales, weather conditions, and fuel prices. The objective is to build a predictive model that forecasts sales based on these factors. The dataset includes historical sales data, weather reports, and fuel price variations to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple files containing:
- **Sales Data**: Market-wise sales details with quantity and pricing information.
- **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, and other meteorological factors.
- **Fuel Pricing Data**: Historical fuel price records that may influence market demand.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Merging datasets from different sources.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Encoding categorical variables and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries.
   - Visualizing trends and relationships using plots and correlation matrices.
3. **Feature Selection & Scaling**
   - Selecting key features affecting sales performance.
   - Normalizing data using `MinMaxScaler`.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Implementing machine learning models such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
   - Evaluating models using performance metrics.
5. **Prediction & Insights**
   - Generating forecasts based on trained models.
   - Interpreting results to understand market behavior.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling.
